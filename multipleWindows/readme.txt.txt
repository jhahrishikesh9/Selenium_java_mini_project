PROJECT TITLE:
Multiple window

To run this file:
1. By default this file will run on MSEdge browser. To change this, go to the excel sheet and change the column B2 from chrome to the respective browser name.
2. To execute it in your computer, give the appropriate location of the drivers in the excel sheet, since the location given is from my pc and would not run in yours.
3. U can run this file using two ways
      a.AS a testNG file
      To execute as a testNG file, just run the implementation file as a testNG file.
      All the reports generated are also attached with the file, since I have executed it using testNG.

      b. As a java application
      To run it as a java application, just run the main method file attached with the codes, since main method is not required while using testNG.
      Then all the outputs generated by the browser is printed in the console.
4. All the outputs generated by the testing is printed in the console.

Thanks :)
